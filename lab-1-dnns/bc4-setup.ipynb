    "We will help you set up SSH so you can connect to [BlueCrystal 4 (BC4)](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/acrc/phase4.htm) \n",
    "and ensure that you have got your environment set up correctly. We'll also discuss some of the basics of the system, \n",

    "**Windows users only:**\n",
    "If you're running windows, [enable WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and install the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distribution from the Microsoft Store. Once installed, open up the Ubuntu application which should launch a bash shell. WSL keeps the linux filesystem separate from the Windows one, however Windows drives are mounted at `/mnt/<drive-letter>`, allowing you to transparently access files on your Windows machine from the Ubuntu subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unable to install WSL, then follow the steps in [Windows setup: Non-WSL](#Windows-setup:-Non-WSL)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Open up `~/.ssh/config` in your editor and add the following lines\n",

    "      HostName bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Then run `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config` so it is only readable by you.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **NOTE:** Make sure to replace `<UoB-username>` with your actual username, e.g. `wp14283`.\n",
    "- If you don't already have an SSH key `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, then generate one with `ssh-keygen` accepting all the defaults.\n",
    "- Copy you SSH public key over to seis and BC4\n",

    "High Performance Computing (HPC) systems like BC4 all are set up in a similar way. Typically there are machines\n",
    "called *login nodes* whose sole purpose is for you to login to (via SSH) and submit jobs (there are 5 of these nodes in BC4). When you SSH onto BC4 you will be placed onto one of these nodes--they are not for running experiments! *Compute nodes* account for the majority\n",
    "of the machines in a super computer (there are 32 nodes in BC4 with dual P100 GPUs), these are the machines that *are* for running experiments. \n",
    "To run something on a compute node, you must wrap it up into a *job*. A job is simply a unit of work, e.g. a script. When you submit a job it is put into a queue of jobs from which compute nodes pull work from until there is none left (except there are always more jobs than machines to complete them!). \n",
    "\n",
    "So how does this work in practice? Well BC4 uses the [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) job management system. Jobs are submitted using `srun` or `sbatch` and the queue is inspected with `squeue`. \n",

    "Let's dig into this a bit deeper and practice running jobs on BC4.\n",
    "We'll differentiate between shells by using the prompt `$` for a shell session on your local computer/laptop, `[bc4] $` for one on a BC4 login node, and `[bc4-compute-node] $` for one on a compute node.\n",
